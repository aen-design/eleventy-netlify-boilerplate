Recently I’ve finished my postgraduate studies in UX Design / Product Design at SWPS University, during which in a team of four we carried out qualitative research, worked on the mobile app prototype in Axure and conducted usability tests. In my free time I’m further developing my skills and knowledge in UX and fields realted to it, I’m interested in creating effective solutions that people use with pleasure.",
