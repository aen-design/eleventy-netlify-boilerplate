Our student team continues to work, currently our four conduct UX research in the field of psychology and education in cooperation with an expert in this field - Karina Mucha.

We discussed the research objectives and research questions, prepared a screener and a research scenario. Work is in full swing, we conducted 10 interviews, analyzed them, drew conclusions and prepared recommendations. Everything was included in one specific report.

At the moment the project is top secret and we can't provide more details, but the whole thing will be released soon!

We are already looking forward to show you the results of this cooperation!
